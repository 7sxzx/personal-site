# Using GatsbyJS to Help My Mutual Aid¬†Network
Building a rapid-response system for volunteers in my area with real-time alerts.

---

<p class="legal">A month ago, I came home to find this note taped to my front door:</p>


![TheLetter](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0TFj_Zbo6Yns6obRHyIqhg.jpeg)

---

I thought this was an awesome idea üöÄ
<p class="legal">(I wasn't the only one!)</p>

---

![Zoom](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*FGN01i-CHXmikoRx1_3Ykw.jpeg)

<p class="legal">The zoom call ü§ô</p>

---

<p class="legal">We defined our scope of help as:</p>

We are volunteering to help each other as a community. As such, of course this is completely free. We are offering help with errands such as picking up urgent supplies, shopping, posting mail, dog walking or just friendly phone call.


---

## But theres a problem ü§î

---

## WhatsApp isn't made for admin.

---

# üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
*"Let me build a site where people can submit requests for help and volunteers can claim them. That way we won't lose any."*

---

## Volunteer first and work out how after

<p class="legal">I had no idea how I was going to build what I just signed up for.</p>

---

# üíº

Can I take some time to work on this?

---

# üéâ

You sure can!

---

My Plan

- One day to get something live.
- Five days to complete the project.

## I reused a lot of old code

- The site was built using one of my [GatsbyJS boilerplates](/boilerplates).
- Styles were taken from my [personal site](/).
- Animations were stolen from a [hackathon project](/projects/beat-street).

---

# MVP üëë

- A landing page
- Resource links
- Volunteer guidelines
- A way for those in need to create requests.
- A way for authorised volunteers to claim these requests and mark them as resolved.

# Pages relying on authentication

I'm no back-end dev

# üî•

## Firebase to the rescue

- Drop-in auth module
- Realtime Database

---

Theres a plugin for that.

```

{
      resolve: "gatsby-plugin-firebase",
      options: {
        credentials: {
          apiKey: process.env.FIREBASE_API_KEY,
          authDomain: process.env.FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN,
          databaseURL: process.env.FIREBASE_DB_URL,
          projectId: process.env.FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,
          storageBucket: process.env.FIREBASE_SB,
          messagingSenderId: process.env.FIREBASE_MSG_SENDER_ID,
          appId: process.env.FIREBASE_APP_ID
        }
      }
    },

```
