# What is GatsbyJS?

---



“You get simplicity by finding slightly more sophisticated building blocks“.

 [*- Alan Kay*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdSD07U5uBs)


---

## A static site generator

- Produces static html files that we load up onto a server.
- No data querying done server side - all sorted at build.

---


## Static site !== static page

We can still add all the JS we want to do dynamic things.


---

## Uses GraphQL to get data from anywhere

We could get content from files, databases other websites - the list goes on!

## Gatsby generates pages for you

- Pass Gatsby content, define a template and it will programmatically create pages for you.
- Gatsby uses Node to generate these pages in development.

---



## 🔌 Built with a plugin architecture

Abstract complex, configurations, or reusable code into a plugin so its away from what your focused on.

---


## 💪 Harnesses ReactJS

Gatsby uses react and stylesheets to help structure page layout.

---

## Project Structure 📁

---

<p class="legal">Typical project structure:</p>

``` 
/
|-- /plugins                //local development plugins
|-- /public                 //the built html and JS files
|-- /src
    |-- /pages              //location of single instance pages
    |-- /templates          //templates for programmatically generated pages
|-- /static                 //static content you want copied to your public folder at build
|-- gatsby-config.js        //core configuration file and plugin handeller
|-- gatsby-node.js          //
|-- gatsby-browser.js       //code that will run on the client browser
```

Takes away logic we all find pernickety:

- *react-router*
- **

---

- modern dev enviroment
- simple tooling 
- modern and clean languages

---

Gatsby has a solid team, open source community and awesome documentation.

🏃‍♂️ Its growing fast.
