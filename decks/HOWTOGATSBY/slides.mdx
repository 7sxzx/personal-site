# What is GatsbyJS?

---

## A Static site generator

- Produces static html files that we load up onto a server.
- No data querying done server side - all preconfigured.

---

## Static site does !== static page

We can still add all the JS we want to do dynamic things.


---

## Gatsby generates pages for you

Pass Gatsby content, define a template and it will programmatically create pages for you.

Gatsby uses Node to generate these pages in development.

---

## Uses GraphQL to get data from anywhere

We could get content from files, databases other websites - the list goes on!

## 💪 Harnesses ReactJS

Gatsby uses react and stylesheets to help structure page layout.

---

## 🔌 Built with a plugin architecture

Abstract complex, configurations, or reusable code into a plugin so its away from what your focused on.

---

“You get simplicity by finding slightly more sophisticated building blocks“.

---

# Why use Gatsby?

---

## ⚡️ Speed

Its hard to beat the speed of sending static output.

---

## 🔑 Security

Extremely secure as you are just sending HTML.

---

## 😍 Developer Experience

---

Takes away logic we all find pernickety:

- *react-router*

---

- modern dev enviroment
- simple tooling 
- modern and clean languages

---

Gatsby has a solid team, open source community and awesome documentation.

🏃‍♂️ Its growing fast.
