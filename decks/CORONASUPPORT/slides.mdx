# Using GatsbyJS to Help My Mutual Aid Network
Building a rapid-response system for volunteers in my area with real-time alerts.

<p class="legal">A month ago, I came home to find this note taped to my front door:</p>

I thought this was an awesome idea 🚀
<p class="legal">(I wasn't the only one!)</p>

<p class="legal">The zoom call 🤙</p>

<p class="legal">We defined our scope of help as:</p>

We are volunteering to help each other as a community. As such, of course this is completely free. We are offering help with errands such as picking up urgent supplies, shopping, posting mail, dog walking or just friendly phone call.

## But theres a problem 🤔

---

## WhatsApp isn't made for admin.

---

# 🙋‍♂️
*"Let me build a site where people can submit requests for help and volunteers can claim them. That way we won't lose any."*

---

## Volunteer first and work out how after

<p class="legal">I had no idea how I was going to build what I just signed up for.</p>

# 💼

Can I take some time to work on this?

---

# 🎉

You sure can!

My Plan

- One day to get something live.
- Five days to complete the project.

I reused a lot of my old code

- The site was built using one of my [GatsbyJS boilerplates](/boilerplates).
- Styles were taken from my [personal site](/).
- Animations were stolen from a [hackathon project](/projects/beat-street).

---

 MVP 👑

- A way for those in need to create requests.
- A way for authorised volunteers to claim these requests and mark them as resolved.
