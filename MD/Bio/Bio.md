### I was born in Canterbury in 1995 but have lived most of my life in Brighton, UK. I'm half English and half Australian.

# I've always had a fascination for the way things work.

### When I was 15 I *borrowed* three broken computers from a skip outside my school. I took them home, opened them up and managed to make a working computer out of the three that were broken. Tinkering with computers has always given me great joy but I had never considered it as a career. No, when I was that age I wanted nothing more than to be an *Civil Engineer*. I completed work experience with [Mott MacDonald](https://www.mottmac.com/) and [Buro Happold](https://www.burohappold.com/). In both cases I was enjoying my interaction with the software I was using, more than the work itself. Maybe software development was for me?

# I like my work to provide value.

### I studied Maths, Physics and Design A-Level at [Cardinal Newman](https://www.cncs.co.uk/) before pursueing a Bachelors in Computer Science at [Kings College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/). During my time there I taught an AI to play pacman and built a visual search engine that attempted to combat fake news. I found university frustrating as most of the things I learned were theoretical. I always like the work I do to provide value and it was because of this that I could not wait to join the world of work. As soon as I was able to I applied for summer internships.

# American Express

### I joined American Express on their technolgy summer internship in 2017. During the ten weeks as a Software Engineer at American Express I worked within an agile team delivering an internal data visualisation tool. The summer strengthed my competency in the Elastic Stack and Java. The company culture was really good and, when they offered me a gradaute position, I did not hesitate to say "yes!".

### I completed two 6 month rotations on the graduate scheme. I tried my hand as a Front End developer and User Experience Designer and realised that I wanted my role to be a mixture of the two. Since then I have joined 'refer a friend' as Design Engineer. Here I design and build the future of the refer a friend scheme at American Express.
