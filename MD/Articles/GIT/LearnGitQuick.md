<h1 class="is-pink">Getting git</h1>
Before anything below works you're going to need to make sure you have git. Head here:

[``` Getting Started Installing Git ```](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git )

Not sure if you have git? Open a terminal and type:

``` git --version ```

If you get a version number back, then congrats you already have git üéâ! If you don't, you'll need to install it. 

<h1 class="is-pink">What is this git thing anyway?</h1>

Git is distributed version control that allows you to track progress over time. Everyone working on the project has their own local copy of it as opposed to working on a centralised copy.

<h1 class="is-pink">Then what the hell is GitHub?</h1>

Github is online storage and access for git. Through the site you can set up repositories where you can store your code. There are also many alternatives to Github such as Bitbucket. As a student, you get private repositories on both of these services for free so make the most of it!

<h1 class="is-pink">How do I make a repository?</h1>

<h1 class="is-pink">How do I get code from git?</h1>

In order to pull code down from a git repository you need to clone the repository using the repository's URL. This creates a local copy for you to work with.  So for example, if you wanted to clone a copy of this website you could use:

```git clone https://github.com/slarsendisney/personal-site.git ```

Just switch out the URL above with wherever your code is stored and you'll be good to go üëç.
